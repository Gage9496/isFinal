    <h2>Submarines Are Larger Than You Think</h2>
    <p>During the cold war, due to the pressure of war the United States and the Soviet Union were in a secret technology war. One that pushed the limited of human creation. This caused things like these massive sumbmarines to be created.</p>

    <p>We see in the movies that they're these tiny iron toobs that can have maybe 5 people in them and even then the crew is sitting shoulder to shoulder.</p>
    <h2>These are some facts about Submarines</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
         <ul>What they hold:
          <li>People (sometimes over 150 crew members!)</li>
          <li>Food and supplies for months</li>
          <li>Missiles and torpedoes(up to 24 huge nuclear missiles)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>They are designed to survive deep underwater. They are extremely silent and go undetected. </li>
      <li>There are 485 active submarines.</li>
      <li>We don't full know what many of the submarines do. Not all of them are for holding missles. Some gather technology from other countries, others are for researching the bottem of the ocean.</li>
    </ol>
